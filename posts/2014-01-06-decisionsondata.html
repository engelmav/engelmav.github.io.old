<p>When my wife and I first moved in, we wanted to make sure we found a spot somewhere between my job and her job. At the time, she used her car to get in (suburbia) but I took the bus. If you’ve ever commuted in New Jersey, I’m sure I don’t have to explain the pain! But I am a big proponent of reducing car usage as much as possible.</p>
<p>Fortunately the following year, my wife got a job closer to NYC, so it was high time to find a new apartment. I started looking at apartments through the many realestate sites around. In the process, I found myself constantly copying the address of an apartment in a realestate listing, pasting it into Google, and using the map as a visual guide to see how far the apartment was from a bus stop. (The NYC bus station is 10 blocks farther north than the train station, and I worked in midtown at the time, so this was preferable.)</p>
<p>I thought to myself, there must be a way to automate this.</p>
<p>First I thought, can I run apartment searches across several sites (for rental ranges, etc), scrape the addresses in the results, and do some kind of Google web API call?</p>
<p>Considering some time constraints (and, for that matter, Google API call constraints), I decided on a more pragmatic (although far less awesome) approach.</p>
<p>It turned out that Google (who else?) came up with a standardized schema for transit data, called <a href="https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference">GTFS</a>. And surprisingly, NJ Transit <a href="https://www.njtransit.com/mt/mt_servlet.srv?hdnPageAction=MTDevLoginTo">publishes data in this format</a>!</p>
<p>My thinking was, perhaps I can list out all the bus lines and sort by something like distance to the NYC bus station or duration of the ride in (the “route”).</p>
<p>The GTFS schema needs to be wrangled. It is dense (completely normalized) and difficult to tease out the table relationships. The documentation is fairly good on Google’s site, but <em>creating</em> your database schema so you can finally query the GTFS CSV files seemed like a full weekend project. Thankfully, as is many times the case, <a href="http://cbick.github.io/gtfs_SQL_importer/html/index.html">someone already wrote a python script</a> to convert the GTFS CSVs to a Postgres database. I was not interested in a <a href="https://code.google.com/p/gtfsdb/">whole ORM implementation</a>, because this was more of a one-off analysis.</p>
<p>So after getting the CSVs in a Postgres database, we do some <a href="https://gist.github.com/engelmav/4246029">unwieldy queries</a> to get a list of bus routes into the Port Authority bus terminal in Manhattan. With some DateTime manipulation in either Perl or Postgres I was able to calculate total durations for each route. The other data point I needed was <em>where</em> (as in, <em>what town</em>) these routes were departing from.</p>
<p>The key here ended up being the <code>stop_lat</code> and <code>stop_lon</code> columns of the <code>stops</code> table. Fantastic, I thought, we’re looking at some proper geocoding. I decided (somewhat arbitrarily) to use <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/boss/geo/">Yahoo’s geocoding API</a>. At the time, it was still completely free but no longer seems to be. It certainly is not expensive for a one-off analysis like this.</p>
<p>The result? There were some 43,000 routes leaving arbitrary locations and arriving at the Port Authority. A moment of silence befell me as I recognized the logistic immensity of NJ Transit.</p>
<p>So I took my report of durations of all trips into Manhattan and looked up the town corresponding to the lattitude and longitude using the Yahoo API. I opened up the resulting CSV, sorted by duration, and saw the towns with the shortest trips at the top.</p>
<p>So we moved to the town with the shortest trip!</p>
